                        In early 2014 I decided to create a card game to play with my friends.  I designed a bunch of cards, both mechanically and visually, as well as created a rule set for the players to follow.
                        I decided to call this game Mystic Labyrinth, and I've been tinkering with the rules and the card design since then.  
                        Player feedback was collected regularly and both the rules and the cards themselves changed quite a few times due to this feedback.  
                        The gameplay also evolved over time, not only to reflect and reinforce the newer rules, but also to incorporate some of the sidelined ideas that were now applicable.

                        This game was part of an assignment to create a singleplayer, 2D platformer by myself.  This was my first forray into game development requiring me to learn how to program and develop my art and animation skills.  
                        I created all the assets, animations and wrote the code for this project over the course of about four to five weeks.  In addition to making a singleplayer game, I needed to animate a roughly twenty second trailer to play at the start.  
                        Overall this project was a massive learning oportunity for me, required me to adapt and learn new skills on the fly.  I learned how to use a multitude of software programs, most of them for the first time so this was a big learning opportunity.

            <h2>Augmented Reality Game</h2>

                        This game was a group effort to create a 2D game with an augmented reality (AR) aspect.  I was given the task of completing the AR portion, so setting up the plug-ins and the hardware, as well as tying it in with the rest of the project.  
                        Part of this was creating a physical object that the camera would pull input from and turn that input into something that a script can use.  
                        This whole project was a very large challenge for me as it was the first time I was working with Unity plug-ins, external hardware input (the webcam rather than the keyboard), as well as working in a group on something like this.  
                        I created the cube pictured on the right, as a physical game piece that the player would roll during the boss fights as part of the AR interaction.  The input taken from the dice would refill the player's hand of cards.  
                        Lastly I had to make sure that my AR portion worked with the rest of the project and didn't break anything, as well as tie my part into the other scripts.
